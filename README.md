# Orthogonal Matching Pursuit

Python implementation of the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit algorithm by Amir Adler, Valentin Emiya, Maria Jafari, Michael Elad, Rémi Gribonval, et al. (“A constrained matching pursuit approach to audio declipping,” in
2011 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal
Processing (ICASSP), May 2011, pp. 329–332.).

The algorithm uses the sparse representation (SR) framework with DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) and DGT (Discrete Gabor Transform) dictionaries, and solves an optional constrained least squares optimization problem to estimate audio signals.
